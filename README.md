Sample API Built With NodeJS, HapiJS, LevelDB, Swaggerui
=================

This is a sample API built with NodeJS, HapiJS, LevelDB, Swaggerui to demonstrate the ease and rapid prototyping abilities of HapiJS and LevelDB. It will also offer a boilerplate app for anyone looking to build an application with this technology stack.

All suggestions, recommendations are welcome. I'm still in the early stages of what I will cover this project, any questions on design choices, or preferences on what areas you would like the app to cover are welcomed, just open an issue.

To build and run:

        $ git clone Clone project
        $ cd hapi-level-sample
        $ npm install
        $ node index.js
        
You can then view the API documentation generated by Swaggerui by visiting: http://localhost:8080/documentation

You will need create a user and remember the token to access the others routes as they require a bearer token to access. Data will be persisted in LevelDB between runs of node.
